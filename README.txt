Nightly Travels of a Witch
by Team Tortilla

What's this?
============

A game. It rules. A lot. Hah.


Why this?
=========

At first survivor and qualle tried to lure flgr to Hannover so that we could have some fun-time but well, he never arrived so
we three had to participate in this contest ;)


System requirements!
====================

Well your system will be qualified to run this game if it has no problems in opening this readme. Maybe. Just pray.


Unnecessary greetings and meaningless words from the team
=========================================================



Too bad we didn't have enough time for actually doing more levels and I *will* eventually make it to Hannover. Hah. Sooner or later. I hope. My team partners are teh rock. And greetings to the cool folks from #72hgdc as well. Next time we'll have to do better time management with less distractions and all that, but it was a lot of fun. :)
Oh, and there's GAMEPAD SUPPORT!


Last but not least the whole lot of coders and watchers in the #72hgdc chan on freenode .. see you next time .... bye.
